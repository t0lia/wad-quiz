  text: My shift is over, I've had enough for tonight!
  description: End the incident here and hand the rest to the next shift.
  conclusion: Alex closes the emergency session while freight keeps breathing and the audit trail keeps waiting. The ship survives the night, though not cleanly and not entirely because of Alex.

  text: Duty calls! Who will fix this mess if not me?! I carry on
  description: Keep the shift and move deeper into the hull gap.
  conclusion: Alex dismisses the handoff notice and moves farther out along the ship's exterior. The software path is alive, but the next scene depends on how much bad certainty Alex has already borrowed.
